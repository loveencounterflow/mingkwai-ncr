# MingKwai-NCR

A derivative of [NCR](https://github.com/loveencounterflow/mingkwai-ncr.git) with extra data for CJK
character processing and typesetting.

## Usage

**Note**â€”This module is intended to be used as is customary with NodeJS / npm modules, i.e. using
`require`:

```coffee
MKNCR = require 'mingkwai-ncr'
```

There are, however, a few points to keep in mind:

* `mingkwai-ncr` only works properly in tandem with `jizura-datasources` and `jizura-db-feeder`;

* those modules are expected to be found within the same
  ['rack'](https://github.com/loveencounterflow/mingkwai-rack) folder as `mingkwai-ncr` itself;

* `mingkwai-ncr/data/isl-entries.json` contains a cached version of the data that is to be organized into
  an [interval skip list](https://github.com/loveencounterflow/interskiplist) for efficient per-codepoint
  retrieval;

* when any data source files are found to be newer than the cache at the point in time when `mingkwai-ncr`
  is `require`d from another module, an exception with a helpful error message will be raised; depending
  on your current location in the file tree, that message might read

  ```
  MINGKWAI-NCR  !  cache file
  MINGKWAI-NCR  !  data/isl-entries.json
  MINGKWAI-NCR  !  is out of date
  MINGKWAI-NCR  ?  run the command
  MINGKWAI-NCR  ?  node lib/main.js
  MINGKWAI-NCR  ?  to rebuild data/isl-entries.json
  ```
